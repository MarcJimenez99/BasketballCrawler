Welcome Your Account Logout Login Create Account   MENU  Players Teams Seasons Leaders Scores Playoffs Draft Stathead Newsletter Full Site Menu Below  You are here: BBR Home Page  > The Linker  > Linker How-To Welcome Your Account Logout Login Create Account                            How to Use the Sports Reference Linker   Add your blog to our player newsfeeds This tool allows you to automatically via just a single click:  Add links to Sports-Reference.com player pages in your blog posts, bulletin board posts, and  You just need to add our bookmarklet and then click it whenever you want to link to our Sports Reference pages.  Javascript bookmarklets are like bookmarks, but slightly different.  A bookmark contains an address for a webpage and clicking on it sends you to that page.  A bookmarklet is a set of javascript instructions for the browser and when you click on it, your browser runs the javascript.  Sometimes this will send you to a different page, but often it may just change what you see on the current page.  Ours adds links to players on Sports Reference sites to the articles you are writing.  Note: that due to a request from Google we are now adding nofollow attributes to both the links we put on your pages and also the links that appear from our sites to your site.  The links still work, but Google no longer considers them for search result purposes.  \t\t         Video Explanation of the Process   Sports Reference Linker Launch Blog Post              Add the Bookmarklet   Create a custom bookmarklet below Basketball-Reference.com Linker Bookmarklet To add to your browser you need to do one of the two following things.    Click on, hold, and then drag the link above to your bookmarks or \tbookmark bar works in FireFox, Safari, and Chrome.  Note that your \tbookmark bar must be visible under View or Bookmarks in Chrome, \tView -> Toolbars in Firefox or View -> Favorites bar in Safari, or  Right Click on the link above and add to favorites or bookmarks doesnt work for Chrome. \tInternet Explorer will ask you if you really want to do this.  It asks \tthis for all cases where you create a javascript bookmarklet since \tthere is the possibility of security issues from untrustworthy \tsites.  To make sure youve done it right you can test it with player names.  If it doesnt work, you can edit the bookmark url which should appear like the following.  Note that there are encoded symbols necessary for the bookmarklet in some browsers listed below that may not appear when clicking edit.  These are of the form %X or %XX.     javascript:function%20sr_link{var%20headID=document.getElementsByTagName%22head%22[0],newScript=document.createElement%22script%22;newScript.type=%22text/javascript%22,newScript.id=%22sr_linker_js%22;var%20random_param=Math.floor1100*Math.random;newScript.src=%22//ssref.com/linker.js%3Fsite=bbr%26lang=en%26foo=0%26test=1%26since_majors=1871%26dobold=no%26rand=%22+random_param,headID.appendChildnewScript}void%20sr_link; \t\t\t        Customize the Bookmarklet        Players Back to up to 1947        Boldface links    Yes    No     Update Bookmarklet     Basketball-Reference.com Linker Bookmarklet To add to your browser, see instructions above. To make sure youve done it right, if you edit the bookmark, the url should appear like the following.  Note that there are encoded symbols necessary for the bookmarklet in some browsers listed below that may not appear when clicking edit.  These are of the form %X or %XX.      javascript:function%20sr_link{var%20headID=document.getElementsByTagName%22head%22[0],newScript=document.createElement%22script%22;newScript.type=%22text/javascript%22,newScript.id=%22sr_linker_js%22;var%20random_param=Math.floor1100*Math.random;newScript.src=%22//ssref.com/linker.js%3Fsite=bbr%26lang=en%26foo=0%26test=1%26since_majors=1871%26dobold=no%26rand=%22+random_param,headID.appendChildnewScript}void%20sr_link; \t\t\t                 How to Use this with Blogs or Bulletin Boards   See a list of supported blog software below.  PLEASE SAVE ANY WORK prior to using the bookmarklet.  While we have made a serious effort to never lose any of your content, we can not make any guarantees. Generally, the easiest way to use the tool is to just write up your post in the blog text box and click the bookmarklet in your brower. The tool grabs the text you wrote, runs it through our player linker and returns the text with links enclosed.     When using with blogs or bulletin boards for adding links to posts while composing, you must click the bookmarklet while using the \"Edit Html\" or \"Html\" view rather than the \"Visual\", \"Rich Text\", or \"Compose\" View.  You can switch back and forth from the two views, so you can write in the Visual view, switch to the HTML view and click the bookmarklet.  Steps  Save your draft Change into HTML view if needed Click the linker bookmarklet A Working notice should appear, and when it disappears all of the player names should be linked.  Test the bookmarklet here     Currently Supported Webpages and Software    Substack Newsletters WordPress TypePad Joomla MovableType Enterprise 4 may also work in 5, but have not tested phpBB invision vBulletin Xenforo Request support for other software      Notes    Names inside of links will be matched as well, to avoid this write something like \"Bill  Russell\" with two spaces rather than \"BillRussell\" with one space.  It will render the same way in HTML since extra spaces are collapsed by default. Player names will be bolded and linked automatically. Names with multiple associated players will go to the search engine results for that name or to the common choice for that name. Search is by longest names to shortest names No matching will occur across hard line returns. A name with a </a> after it will not be matched, so it wont overwrite existing links.
